1) Create a new text file in your repo; you can use your “normal” tools for this, don’t feel tied to the command line as the repo is just a normal directory with a few superpowers.

then run 'git status'
then 'git add' the file to the repo
the check status with 'git status'
then do a 'git commit' and use the vim editor (the default config editor)
